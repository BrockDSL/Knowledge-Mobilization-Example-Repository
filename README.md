# Getting all your work in one place!
This repository is intended to serve as template and guide for taking all the components of a project and bringing them together in one place.

## Why use GitHub?
GitHub is the perfect place to share your work publicly as it is free, public, and searchable!

Another reason to use GitHub is that it does many of the things you might want for knowledge mobilization in one place:

 - Store a version of your paper, article, thesis, report, etc in a freely accecible and open location
 - Store all of the files associated with your work such as datasets, metadata files, instruction on how to reproduce your work, pre-made citations, pictures, videos, visualizations, and more!
 - Host a webpage (completely free!)
 - Create an automated workflow that will allow others to run the same analysis that you performed on your data to test your methods or even try it out on their own data!
 - Monitor your repository and gather statistics on views (if you have a webpage you can also add Google Analytics for even more data!)

# Try it for yourself!
This repository demonstrates all of the above features and can be cloned and adjusted to fit your projects!  In the section below, each component is broken down with instructions on how to replicate it.
