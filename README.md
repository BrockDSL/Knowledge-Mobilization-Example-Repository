# Getting all your work in one place!
This repository is intended to serve as template and guide for taking all the components of a project and bringing them together in one place.

## Why use GitHub?
GitHub is the perfect place to share your work publicly as it is free, public, and searchable!

Another reason to use GitHub is that it does many of the things you might want for knowledge mobilization in one place:

 - Store a version of your paper, article, thesis, report, etc in a freely accecible and open location
 - Store all of the files associated with your work such as datasets, metadata files, instruction on how to reproduce your work, pre-made citations, pictures, videos, visualizations, and more!
 - Host a webpage (completely free!)
 - Create an automated workflow that will allow others to run the same analysis that you performed on your data to test your methods or even try it out on their own data!
 - Monitor your repository and gather statistics on views (if you have a webpage you can also add Google Analytics for even more data!)

# Try it for yourself!
This repository demonstrates all of the above features and can be used as a model for your projects!  In the section below, each component is broken down with instructions on how to replicate it.

Before you can start exploring all the wonders of GitHub, you will need to sign up for an account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)

## Creating a Repository
The first step to any great project in GitHub is to make a repoisitory for that project.  In GitHub you can make as many public repositories as you want completely for free!  You can also make as many private repositories as you want to fill with your private files but some of the extra features like the ability to make a webpage will be limited unless you pay a fee.  

To make a repository:
- Make sure you are logged in to GitHub.com and on your dashboard (the default view when you log in)
- Click the green button at the top left (It should say either "New" or "Create Repository")
- Fill in the form with:
  - The name of the repository (All spaces in the name you pick will be replaced by dashes upon creating the repository since names in GitHub can't have spaces)
  - A description of the repository (Keep it brief.  Ideally one short sentence)
  - If you want the repository to be Public or Private
  - Choose if you want a README file automatically created for you (Highly reccomended as a README file has many uses!)
  - Decide if you want to add a gitignore file (Not needed for most uses.  For more information on gitignore files, see the [Ignoring Files section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files) of the GitHub documentation)
  - Decide if you want to add a license to your repository.  
    - From the GitHub Documentation: "Without a license added here, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. If you're creating an open source project, we strongly encourage you to include an open source license"
    - For more information on how licenses work on a repository, see the [Licensing a Repository section](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) of the GitHub documentation
  - Click the "Create Repository Button"
